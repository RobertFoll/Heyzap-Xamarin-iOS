A Xamarin wrapper for the Heyzap iOS SDK
A sample project is included. For the technical specifications and documentation of the SDK, see http://www.heyzap.com

This is my personal project, I'm not affiliated with Heyzap in any way. I appreciate all your input, feedback, and especially contributions! The binding was built using Xamarin.iOS as a Unified API iOS Binding Project using Heyzap iOS SDK version 9.3.4.

Instructions
Obtain a publisherID at heyzap.com.
Follow the instructions in the readme files for both the binding and sample projects.
